# Changelog

All notable changes to TokenMeter are tracked here. Versions follow semver.
The "Unreleased" section captures work merged but not yet tagged.

## v1.0.2 — 2026-05-21

### Performance
- SQL push-down for `daily` / `weekly` / `monthly` / `session`:
  daily warm 1.22s → 0.99s (1.23×); weekly/monthly ~1.14×; session ~1.06×.
  blocks unchanged (5h identification needs raw timeline).
- See `docs/perf/v1.0.2-baseline.md` for full pprof + benchmark breakdown
  and v1.0.3 optimization candidates (covering index est. 30–50% further win).

### Fixed
- `Mode=auto` 在 non-breakdown 路径下不再 silent 丢失零成本 entries 的 fallback
  recompute。v1.0.1 是 per-entry fallback；push-down 后 bucket SUM 会掩盖个体零成本
  行。修复：cli 在 Mode=auto && !user-Breakdown 时透明强制 storage filter.Breakdown=true，
  渲染时按 bucket 折叠回单行（用户视图不变）但 cost 按 (bucket, model) 重算。混合天
  cost 可恢复 ~$11k 量级真实金额（实测本地 DB 由 $57769 修正为 $69284）。

### Added
- `blocks --breakdown` 嵌套显示 per-model 子行（v1.0.1 known limitation 补齐）。
- `session --json` 输出含 `projectPath` / `lastActivity` 字段（来自 SQL
  `MAX(s.cwd)` / `MAX(u.timestamp)`）。

### Known limitations (carry-forward)
- `--timezone <IANA>` 用查询时刻的 UTC offset；DST 区跨 DST 边界的历史数据可能
  ±1h 误分桶。Workaround：UTC 或固定 offset alias。

## v1.0.1 — 2026-05-20

### Added
- `--json` actually takes effect on `tm daily` / `tm weekly` / `tm monthly` / `tm session` / `tm blocks`. The envelope is camelCase with a top-level wrapper (`daily` / `weekly` / `monthly` / `sessions` / `blocks` + `totals`) aligned with ccusage v20.
- `--breakdown` actually renders per-model subrows for `tm daily` / `tm weekly` / `tm monthly` / `tm session`. Boxed output uses a `└─ <model>` nest; JSON adds a `modelBreakdowns[]` field on each row.
- `--order desc` reverses the row order across daily / weekly / monthly / session.
- `--mode auto|calculate|display` now applies for every cost-aware subcommand. `calculate` rewrites cost from `tokens × pricing.Resolve(model)`; `auto` only recomputes when the source row's cost is zero; `display` passes through unchanged.
- `--timezone <IANA>` reroutes timestamp bucketing through the named zone (e.g. `--timezone Asia/Shanghai` puts 23:30 UTC into the next day).
- `--project <path>` filters all subcommands by `sessions.cwd`.
- `--no-color` actually suppresses ANSI escapes, with autodetection for non-TTY writers plus `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable support (`FORCE_COLOR` wins on TTYs, `NO_COLOR` wins everywhere else).
- Table output aligned with ccusage: 8 / 9 column rounded box with TOTAL footer, Models cyan, token columns yellow, COST red, block STATUS (`ACTIVE` green / `gap` faint / `closed` dim).
- Empty range prints `(no data in range)` instead of a bare header.
- `--cpu-profile <path>` hidden flag writes a Go pprof CPU profile for `tm <subcommand>` invocations (developer tool — not advertised in `tm help`).

### Changed
- `tm` with no subcommand now runs `daily` (matching ccusage). `tm help`, `tm -h`, `tm --help` still surface the help text.
- `--until YYYYMMDD` is now an inclusive close to the end of that day. Internally the parsed timestamp is bumped +24h before being compared with the loader's `<= until`, so an entry at 2026-05-20 23:59 is included when you ask for `--until 20260520`. Previously a half-open interval that silently dropped same-day data. See `docs/MIGRATION-v1.0.md`.

### Performance
- v1.0.1 baseline: `docs/perf/v1.0.1-baseline.md`. On a 1,587-session / 445,904-row / 549 MB local DB, warm `tm daily` runs at ~820 ms; cold ~2.4 s. Top hotspot is SQLite page reads via `syscall.Pread` (71.4% flat). v1.0.2 optimization candidates documented but not committed: `token_usage(timestamp DESC)` index, SQL-side `GROUP BY` push-down for the daily/weekly/monthly path, selective `SELECT` when `Mode != calculate`.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-05-20

### Breaking
- TUI removed. `tm` (no arguments) now prints help instead of entering an interactive interface.

### Deprecated (will be removed in v2.0)
- `tm cost` → use `tm daily`
- `tm report` → use `tm session` / `tm weekly` / `tm monthly`
- `tm status` → use `tm blocks --active`
- `tm top` → use `tm blocks --active`

### Added
- `tm daily`, `tm weekly`, `tm monthly`, `tm session` — ccusage-style aggregate reports.
- `tm blocks`, `tm blocks --active` — 5-hour session block view with burn rate and projection.
- `tm statusline` — Claude Code statusline provider (`stdin JSON → stdout line`).
- `--session-length` flag to customize block window.
- LiteLLM-sourced pricing snapshot with weekly auto-refresh PR.
- `--mode auto|calculate|display` cost mode.
- `--since` / `--until` / `--project` now apply to `tm daily` / `tm weekly` / `tm monthly` / `tm session` / `tm blocks` (previously silently ignored).

### Limitations (to be addressed in v1.0.1)
- `--json` is honored by `tm blocks` but not yet by `tm daily` / `tm weekly` / `tm monthly` / `tm session`.
- `--breakdown` (model breakdown) and `--order desc` are not wired through aggregate output.
- `--mode auto|calculate|display` defaults to `display`; the calculate path is implemented in `internal/pricing.Apply` but not yet selected at the CLI layer.

## v0.8.3 — 2026-05-19 — Cross-platform CI fixes

v0.8.2 functionally shipped to `main`, but its `ci.yml` `release` job
was skipped because the Linux and Windows test matrices uncovered
cross-platform fixture issues that were invisible on darwin. v0.8.3
fixes every one of them so the same v0.8.2 feature set is the first
release to publish six-platform artifacts.

### Linux test fixtures

- **`gofmt cmd/tm/cmd_help.go`** (`5c792c8`) — restores the spacing
  regression introduced in the `f8204f8` budget seeAlso entry.
- **`TestFDSnapshotReturnsList`** (`f59bcd7`) opens a canary file so
  the assertion no longer depends on stdin/stdout/stderr surviving
  Linux's `/proc/self/fd` noise filter (pipes and `/dev/null` are
  filtered, so the snapshot returned zero elements on the runner).
- **`TestRemoteSubscriberCleanupOnSlowConsumer`** (`a6189b7`) inflates
  the broadcast payload to ~4 KB so 200 events overflow Linux's 208 KB
  unix-socket sndbuf. macOS sndbuf is ~8 KB, so the test already
  overflowed there; the test now exercises the cleanup path on both
  platforms.

### Windows test infrastructure

- **`internal/daemon/socket_windows.go`** (`0c97b71`) — real socket
  lock using `os.O_CREATE | os.O_EXCL` on a sidecar `.lock` file plus
  `tasklist`-based stale-PID detection. Previously a no-op stub, so
  two Windows daemons could share the same port without complaint and
  `TestStartRefusesIfSocketAlreadyLive` could never observe
  `ErrExist`.
- **`daemonPIDRunning` split** (`0c97b71`) into
  `cmd/tm/doctor_pid_unix.go` (`syscall.Signal(0)` probe) and
  `doctor_pid_windows.go` (`tasklist` check), so `tm doctor` no longer
  always reports the daemon as stale on Windows.
- **`captureStdout` reader goroutine** (`0c97b71`) is now started
  before the captured function runs, draining the pipe while the
  function writes. Fixes `windows-latest` hangs when `runDoctor`
  output exceeded Windows's smaller anonymous pipe buffer.
- **Six narrower fixture adjustments** (`06f29f6`):
  `TestDefaultLogPath` uses `setTestHome` for full env coverage;
  `TestRunReload*` gated to `!windows` (Windows reload is a Unix-only
  stub); `TestRunTopRespectsInterval` and
  `TestFTS5BackfillsOnUpgrade` skip on Windows (runner timing /
  SQLite WAL release); `TestRunWebGenerateToken` tolerates the
  Windows file-mode mapping; `TestHandleCostsTodayIncludesLocal
  EarlyMorning` no longer slips its fallback seed into yesterday.
- **Tightened `TestRunTopOnceProducesSnapshot`** (`06f29f6`) seeds
  from now−3h to now−2m so the test passes regardless of when the
  wall clock fires.

### CI plumbing

- **`go test` timeout raised from 180s to 600s** (`62ba70b`); the
  `windows-latest` runner needs the extra headroom under `-race`,
  while `ubuntu-latest` still finishes well under a minute.

### Production code touched

- New `internal/daemon/socket_windows.go` (real lock).
- New `cmd/tm/doctor_pid_unix.go` / `cmd/tm/doctor_pid_windows.go`
  (split daemon-PID probe).

Everything else in v0.8.3 is `_test.go` fixtures or YAML config; no
behavior change for end users on macOS or Linux.

## v0.8.2 — 2026-05-18

A polish-and-stabilize release: web dashboard gets a visual refresh, five
auto-generated insight cards plus a cost-forecast endpoint, a calendar
heatmap and cost sunburst, real Windows support across daemon and tests,
the PWA picks up versioned caches and an update banner, and the release
pipeline is consolidated onto a single `ci.yml` path so tag pushes stop
failing on duplicate goreleaser runs.

### Highlights

- **Web dashboard visual upgrade** (`d314297`) — glassmorphism cards with
  `backdrop-filter: blur(...) saturate(180%)`, spring hover lift
  (`translateY(-2px)` + accent glow), `tabular-nums` on every numeric
  metric, ambient radial-gradient body background gated by
  `prefers-reduced-motion` and high-contrast, and an SSE value-flash so
  changed numbers briefly highlight without flicker.
- **Auto-generated insight cards** (`e3e0846` API + `61d5bff` UI) —
  `GET /api/insights?range=today|week|month|all` returns up to five
  insights (`peak_day`, `top_tool`, `model_mix_shift`, `cost_anomaly`,
  `rhythm`), each with `{id, kind, title, body, value, metadata}`. The
  frontend renders glass cards with per-insight dismiss persisted to
  localStorage; dismiss resets automatically when the underlying value
  changes.
- **Cost forecast endpoint** (`208c68e`) — `GET /api/forecast?period=...`
  returns `spent_to_date`, `burn_rate_per_day` (7-day rolling),
  `projected_total`, `projected_remaining`, `confidence`
  (`low|medium|high`), `trend` (`up|down|stable`), and
  `vs_previous_period`. Two DB round-trips, no shared state, panic-safe.
- **Calendar heatmap + cost sunburst** (`b955750`) — 13-week
  GitHub-style activity heatmap with quantile-tiered cells
  (`--heatmap-q0..q4`, dark / high-contrast aware) plus a 2-ring sunburst
  (platform → model) with keyboard navigation. Both have SR-only
  fallbacks.
- **Audit-driven polish** (`1e0a74d`) — eight of the top-ten web audit
  findings landed: `setPref` no longer redraws charts for non-theme
  changes (A2), nine input elements gained `aria-label` (C1), session
  detail Back restores scroll position (B1), a global
  `:where(...):focus-visible` outline (C4), `applyDashboardData` wraps
  `renderChart` / `renderModels` / `renderTools` in `requestIdleCallback`
  (A1), `.heatmap-section` / `.sunburst-card` / `.ic-charts-section`
  pick up `content-visibility: auto` (E3 + A5), tap targets land on
  `min-height: 36px` with a desktop override at 768px (B7), and hero
  metrics span the full row at 640px (B6). Chart consolidation (E1) and
  virtual-scroll Map diff (A3) are intentionally postponed.
- **PWA update banner** (`1e0a74d`) — `controllerchange` listener and
  `SKIP_WAITING` postMessage path so new SW versions surface a glass
  banner ("新版本可用 / 立即刷新 / ×") instead of forcing a manual
  reload.
- **PWA infrastructure** (`6411ab7`) — `sw.js` rewritten with versioned
  cache pool (`tm-v2-static` / `tm-v2-api`), API GET on network-first
  with a 5s timeout and cached-JSON fallback marked
  `X-TokenMeter-Cache: hit`, static assets stale-while-revalidate gated
  on `request.destination`, SSE pass-through for `/api/events`. New
  `icon-maskable.svg` for Android Adaptive Icon and a `manifest.json`
  with `short_name "TM"` plus Today / Sessions / Analytics shortcuts.

### Real Windows support

- **Workspace filter uses `path.Clean`** (`2db25dc`) — previously
  `filepath.Clean` silently converted `/foo` to `\foo` on Windows,
  breaking workspace-filtered session lists.
- **Daemon picks OS-assigned TCP ports on Windows via `:0`** (`0dea537`)
  — fixes bind conflicts when tests restart the daemon rapidly.
- **Test fixtures cover `USERPROFILE` / `HOMEDRIVE` / `HOMEPATH`**
  (`38eb2d2`) so `t.Setenv("HOME", ...)` actually isolates on Windows
  where `os.UserHomeDir()` reads `USERPROFILE`.
- **Three tests skip on Windows** (`babf734`) for documented
  environmental differences: modernc SQLite WAL release timing, Windows
  ACL semantics for `os.Chmod(0o555)`, and GitHub Actions Windows runner
  I/O latency too slow for the existing p99 budget.

### Release pipeline

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml` removed** (`69d98be`) — it
  duplicated `ci.yml`'s `release` job and caused every tag push to fail
  at the second goreleaser invocation. `ci.yml` is now the single
  canonical release path (lint + cross-platform test matrix +
  goreleaser with conditional `--skip=homebrew`).
- **`.goreleaser.yml` on v2 schema** (`d844360`) — `archives.formats`
  array, `homebrew_casks` replacing `brews` (with `binaries: ["tm"]`
  instead of a Ruby `install` block), and a `skip_upload` template
  using `index .Env` that gracefully no-ops when
  `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` is absent (`6e8c145`).
- **Brew install command** updated to `brew install --cask tt-a1i/tap/tm`
  (`1a536cc`) across `README.md`, `README_EN.md`, `docs/design.md`, and
  `CLAUDE.md`.

### Documentation

- **`docs/api.md`** (`c47bff7`) — 868 lines covering all 17 HTTP
  endpoints in a consistent five-section template (description,
  parameters, response, errors, curl example, source location).

### Preserved (no migration needed)

- Module path `github.com/tt-a1i/tokenmeter`
- Data paths `~/.tokenmeter/`, `tokenmeter.db`, `tokenmeter.sock`,
  `tokenmeter.log`
- Prometheus metric namespace `tokenmeter_*`
- localStorage keys and Service Worker caches — legacy
  `tokenmeter-static-v2` / `tokenmeter-api-v1` pools are auto-evicted on
  first `tm-v2-*` activation (no user action required).

### Documentation fixes

Audit-driven (`f8204f8`):

- `tm web --help` no longer lists a non-existent `--host` flag and now
  documents the real authentication flags (`--token`, `--no-auth`,
  `--generate-token`).
- `tm version --help` documents `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `tm budget --help` includes a `tm budget delete <id>` example.
- README.md / README_EN.md command tables: `tm cost [period]` lists the
  six accepted values (today / week / month / 3month / year / all)
  instead of the stale `[today|week]`.
- README_EN.md gains rows for `tm web`, `tm report --weekly`, and
  `tm report --monthly` (previously English readers couldn't discover
  the web dashboard entry point or weekly/monthly reports).

## v0.8.1 — 2026-05-17 — Fix Windows build

- Split `cmd/tm/reload` into `reload_unix.go` (build tag `!windows`) and
  a Windows stub returning a clear error. Restores cross-platform builds
  for goreleaser windows_amd64 / arm64 and CI Vet on windows-latest.
- No functional change on macOS / Linux versus v0.8.0.

## v0.8.0 — 2026-05-17 — Rename to tm with auto-setup; web flicker fix

### Highlights
- **Binary renamed** `tokenmeter` → `tm`. `cmd/tokenmeter/` moved to `cmd/tm/`
  so `go install github.com/tt-a1i/tokenmeter/cmd/tm@latest` produces a
  short `tm` binary directly.
- **Auto-setup on first run** — `tm` / `tm daemon` / `tm web` silently
  inject Claude Code hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` on first
  invocation. Manual `tm setup` retained for repair. Legacy
  `tokenmeter emit` and `agmon emit` hook entries are detected as
  already-installed; explicit `tm setup` rewrites them.
- **Web dashboard flicker fixed** — full dashboard repaints (6 metric
  cards, 3 Canvas charts, sessions list, sparkline) on every SSE
  `token_usage` event are now coalesced into a 200ms window. In-memory
  totals (allS / lastStats / lastCosts) still update synchronously so
  optimistic state remains accurate.
- **goreleaser v2 migration** — `archives.formats` (array form),
  `homebrew_casks` replacing `brews`, `skip_upload` template
  gracefully no-ops when `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` is absent.
  Brew install command is now `brew install --cask tt-a1i/tap/tm` (cask
  tap pending activation).
- **CI / Docker / release pipelines** updated for renamed binary.

### Preserved (no migration needed)
- Module path `github.com/tt-a1i/tokenmeter`
- Data paths `~/.tokenmeter/`, `tokenmeter.db`, `tokenmeter.sock`,
  `tokenmeter.log`
- Prometheus metric namespace `tokenmeter_*`
- localStorage keys and Service Worker cache names — onboarding state
  and offline cache survive the upgrade

## v0.7.0 — 2026-05-17

This release rolls up a multi-round hardening pass covering security,
correctness, time-zone behavior, observability, and test/benchmark
infrastructure. No new user-facing features; everything is reliability,
safety, and developer ergonomics.

### Security

- **Unix socket now mode `0600`** — `~/.tokenmeter/tokenmeter.sock` and the
  subscriber socket are chmod'd to owner-only after `Listen`. Previously
  the default umask left them at `0644`, which on Linux/macOS lets any
  local user inject fake hook events into the daemon. Same-host attackers
  can no longer poison your usage data without already running as your UID.
  A µs-level TOCTOU window between Listen and Chmod is documented; for
  strict guarantees wrap the daemon start in `syscall.Umask(0o077)`.
- **HTTP server hardening** — `tokenmeter web` now sets
  `ReadHeaderTimeout=5s` / `ReadTimeout=30s` / `WriteTimeout=30s` /
  `IdleTimeout=60s`, and SIGINT/SIGTERM triggers `srv.Shutdown(ctx)` so
  in-flight requests drain before the process exits. Slowloris-style hangs
  are no longer possible.
- **`/api/session/{id}` no longer leaks internal errors** — ambiguous
  prefix matches return a 400 with a user-friendly message; any other DB
  error (SQL syntax, table names, driver internals) becomes a generic
  500 with the detail logged server-side only.

### Correctness — time zones

- **All daily aggregates now bucket by local time** — `DATE(timestamp,
  'localtime')` plus matching local-time `from`/`to` boundaries in
  `web/`, `tui/`, and `cmd/`. Stored timestamps remain UTC; the change is
  purely query-side. For a UTC+8 user, "Today's cost" now matches the
  local calendar instead of starting at UTC midnight (= local 08:00).
- **`GetDailyCostsBetween` is now inclusive of endDay** — the previous
  half-open `[from, to)` semantics dropped today's partial bar when
  callers passed `to = now` mid-day.
- **`GetFirstTokenDate` returns a local-day anchor** — `range=all` no
  longer shows an empty first-day bucket from UTC/local offset.

### Correctness — data integrity

- **`parseTimestamp` returns `(time.Time, bool)`** instead of falling
  back to `time.Now()`. Malformed Codex/Claude log timestamps no longer
  pollute today's cost — affected events are dropped instead.
- **`truncate` is rune-safe** — tool params/results truncated mid-rune no
  longer produce invalid UTF-8 in storage (Chinese, emoji, etc.).
- **`bufio.Scanner` buffer raised to 16MB** in `extractPatchFileChanges`
  — apply_patch bodies with lines >64KB (minified JS, base64) no longer
  silently drop the rest of the patch.
- **Watcher truncation/rotation detected** — when a Claude/Codex JSONL
  file shrinks since the last scan, the watcher resets the byte offset
  to 0 and re-reads. `source_id` UNIQUE indexes prevent double-counting.
- **`codex pendingFileChanges` map now has a 2-hour TTL GC** running
  every ~30s — orphaned `function_call` entries (codex died mid-call)
  no longer leak the map.
- **Schema migrations are gated by `PRAGMA user_version`** — the legacy
  `normalizeTimeColumns` full-table scan no longer runs on every daemon
  restart. Set once, skipped forever.
- **`MarkStaleSessionsEnded(2h)` now runs on a 1-hour ticker** — a
  daemon running for days no longer accumulates `active` zombies.
- **`addColumnIfMissing` uses `PRAGMA table_info`** instead of string-
  matching the driver's error message.

### Performance

- **3 new time indexes** on hot aggregation paths:
  `idx_token_usage_ts`, `idx_tool_calls_start`, `idx_file_changes_ts`.
  First upgrade reopens an old DB will spend a few seconds building
  these; subsequent INSERTs are virtually free to maintain.
- **`/api/sessions?limit=N` query parameter** (capped at 1000). Default
  remains 200; the `/api/stats` `total_sessions` count now uses the
  same filter as `ListSessions` so the dashboard and stats numbers
  agree.
- **11 benchmarks added** as performance regression baselines:
  `broadcast` (~62 ns/op), `processEvent TokenUsage` (~140 µs/op),
  `ParseClaudeFileEvents`, `extractPatchFileChanges`, `truncate`,
  `GetDailyCostsBetween` (~4 ms / 500 rows), `GetCostBetween`,
  `GetModelCostBreakdown`, `ListSessions`, `GetActiveSessionCount`,
  `UpdateSessionTokens`. Future regressions surface immediately.

### Observability

- **Daemon `Stats()` counters** — `dropped_broadcasts`,
  `dropped_shutdown`, `duplicate_tool_starts` atomic counters surfaced
  in the daemon Stop log so operators can spot slow subscribers,
  shutdown-window event loss, or Pre-hook re-emit anomalies.
- **`ProcessExternalEventAsync` uses a two-stage send** — non-blocking
  first try; falls back to blocking with the `done` channel as a
  backstop. The previous random-select made shutdown-window event loss
  more likely than it had to be.
- **Second Ctrl+C force-quits** — `tokenmeter daemon` and `tokenmeter
  web` now install a watchdog goroutine that calls `os.Exit(130)` if a
  user impatiently presses Ctrl+C while graceful shutdown is in
  progress.
- **`emit.log` for `tokenmeter emit` errors** — the hook entry point
  logs to `~/.tokenmeter/emit.log` (10MB self-truncate) instead of
  stderr, so error chatter never pollutes Claude Code's hook
  stdout/stderr parsing.

### Refactors

- **`claude_log.go` extracts `parseClaudeLogTokenEvent`** — single
  source of truth for assistant-message token parsing, shared by both
  the parallel initial scan and the incremental processFile loop.
- **`HTTP Server` built in `NewServer`** — `Start()`/`Shutdown(ctx)`
  pair is now race-free at the cost of moving mux registration out of
  Start.
- **`storage.ErrAmbiguousSessionPrefix` sentinel** — callers use
  `errors.Is` to split user-input errors (400) from system errors (500)
  without parsing error strings.
- **`view_messages.go` chunked rendering** — no longer infinite-loops
  on extremely narrow terminals; preserves user content at the
  `len(remaining) == maxCols` boundary where the previous length-based
  detection mistook a truncated chunk for a complete one.

### Test infrastructure

- **~78 new tests** across all packages — boundary cases, regression
  guards, contract tests, and a TUI keyboard handler harness covering
  17 key events (q / Tab / Shift-Tab / j / k / G / [ / ] / / / Esc /
  Enter / t / p / s / c / r and several window/tick/refresh messages).
- **Coverage gains** (Round 0 → final):
  - cmd/tokenmeter: 33.7% → 53.3%
  - internal/appdir: 87.0% → 95.7%
  - internal/collector: 71.2% → 83.4%
  - internal/daemon: 62.9% → 77.8%
  - internal/report: 80.2% → 88.4%
  - internal/storage: 77.0% → 83.9%
  - internal/tui: 49.2% → 70.9%
  - internal/web: 62.2% → 73.0%

### Upgrade notes

- **First reopen of an existing database** will create three new time
  indexes; expect a few seconds of extra startup time on a database
  with hundreds of thousands of token rows. One-time cost.
- **`tokenmeter web` dashboard "today" / "this week" / "this month"
  values may shift by hours after upgrading** if the host is not in
  UTC — the buckets now align with local calendar days instead of UTC
  midnight. Totals over longer periods are unchanged; only the
  per-bucket numbers move.
- **Existing 0644 socket files from older daemons are removed and
  recreated at 0600** on the next start. No manual action required.
